    The main benefit of Local Activities is that they use less Temporal service resources (e.g. lower state transitions) and have much lower latency overhead (because no need to roundtrip to the Cluster) compared to normal Activity Executions.
    However, Local Activities are subject to shorter durations and a lack of rate limiting.
