 The main benefit of Local Activities is that they use less <22>2</22> service resources (e.g. lower state transitions) and have much lower latency overhead (because no need to roundtrip to the Cluster) compared to normal <22>1<22> Executions. However, Local Activities are subject to shorter durations and a lack of rate limiting.
