<!--<p>If this timeout is used, we recommend setting this timeout to the maximum time a Workflow Execution is willing to wait for an Activity Execution in the presence of all possible Worker outages, and have a concrete plan in place to reroute Activity Tasks to a different Task Queue.-->
<!--    This timeout <strong>does not</strong> trigger any retries regardless of the Retry Policy, as a retry would place the Activity Task back into the same Task Queue.-->
<!--    We do not recommend using this timeout unless you know what you are doing.</p>-->
